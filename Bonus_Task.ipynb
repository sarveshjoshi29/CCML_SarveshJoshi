    "### 1) It is likely generated by a Decision Tree. Decision tree classifies data based on different conditional boundaries (like x>5 , y<4 etc..) In the given decision boundary plot we can see regions which are likely to correspond to some node of the tree\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2) It is likely generated by a Random Forest. Random Forest uses multiple Decision Trees which is why we get a very noisy decision boundary\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3) It is likely generated via a non linear SVC(Support Vector Classification) model. Nonlinear SVC produces a smooth continuous polynomial or curvilinear decision boundary\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4) It is likely generated by a Naive Bayes model which generally produces an elliptical sort of decision boundary\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5) It is likely produced by a KNearestNeighbors (KNN) model. The decision boundary produced by a KNN model is very jagged and depends highly on local data because it takes into account local data points for prediction."
